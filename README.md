# Traveling_Planning_Assisntant

The big data analysis in transportation industry has shown great importance in travel planning and distribution. 

In this project, we propose a travel planning system that predicts the traveling cost and taxi pick-up hotspots from large sets of NYC taxi data. 

In order to achieve the best prediction in New York City area, we studied and implemented machine learning models including: 1) Random Forest Regression; 2) Linear Regression; 3) K-Nearest Neighbor. Finally, the best trained model from each algorithm are combined to build the Travel Planning System Website. 

Experimental results demonstrate the correctness of our proposed method for travel planning and cost prediction.
